                        <p>It would be entirely appropriate to ask Hannah about how and when she takes her medication in order to assess her adherence. It would also be right to ask her about how she feels about adding in more medication to reach a lower target or whether she is happier with a slightly higher target than might be recommended in someone younger, in order to avoid any possible side effects. It would not be appropriate to lecture Hannah or suggest that the rise in her HbA1c levels is her ‘fault’ as this could lead to a breakdown in the therapeutic relationship.1 A glycaemic target of 59mmol/mol is appropriate for ‘biologically young’ older adults.2 Very few people with diabetes, aged 70 years or older, would be anticipated to benefit from intensive intervention to targets below 53mmol/mol (7.0%).2 Care must be taken when adding in therapies, as the consequences of hypoglycaemia may be just as severe in
                        the fit as the frail older adult.2</p>

                    <p>Hannah is taking her metformin as prescribed and has not noticed any changes in her diet or activity levels that might explain the rise in her HbA1c over the past 6 months. Her current BMI is 26.8kg/m2 and this has been stable for the past few years, although it has been higher in the past. Hannah tries to keep her weight down as much as she can. Her HbA1c is 59mmol/mol, just above the threshold NICE recommends for intensification of therapy. Her most recent eGFR is 54ml/min/1.73m2, indicating mild renal impairment.

                        <p>Sulfonylureas can cause weight gain and hypoglycaemia,1 and as Hannah works hard at keeping her weight under control they would not be an ideal choice for this patient. Furthermore, because she lives alone it would be preferable to avoid any drug that might
                        increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. Pioglitazone has a low risk of hypoglycaemia but is associated with weight gain.1 Pioglitazone is also associated with an increased risk of heart failure, bladder cancer and bone fracture, and risk factors for these
                        conditions – including increased age – should be carefully evaluated before treatment.2 DPP-4 inhibitors have been used in frail and elderly patients, and have similar efficacy in older patients to that in younger populations.3 In patients with renal impairment, a DPP-4
                        inhibitor that doesn’t require dose adjustment, (for example, linagliptin [Trajenta®]) might be a suitable option.4 If Hannah’s kidney function was not reduced, an alternative would be an SGLT2 inhibitor, which works by preventing reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys.
                        This leads to increased excretion of glucose in the urine, (averaging approximately 78 g/day) resulting in an immediate reduction in blood glucose levels. However, the majority of SGLT2 inhibitors are not indicated in patients with an eGFR 60ml /min/1.73m2.5 </p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>Hannah is now taking metformin with a DPP-4 inhibitor. Her general practice nurse has recommended that she should have another HbA1c test in 3 months’ time to assess her response to this first intensification of therapy. What target should Hannah be aiming for                 on this new regimen?</p>
