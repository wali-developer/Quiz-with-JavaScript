            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Increasingly, day-to-day management of people with type 2 diabetes falls to general practice nurses
                (GPNs).1 It is therefore important that they are familiar with the latest guidelines, and understand how
                to apply the recommendations to their individual patients. This includes recognising how to determine
                appropriate targets (for example, for blood glucose control) in each individual case. <br> <br> This
                module will help improve awareness of the role of adequate blood glucose control in the prevention of
                the complications of diabetes.</p>

                    <h3>Setting targets</h3>
                    <hr class="line2">
                    <p>The focus on strict numerical targets for hypoglycaemic control has changed in recent years,
                        allowing greater flexibility in recognition of
                        the needs of individuals. <br> <br>
                        Reducing HbA1c levels is associated with a reduction in microvascular and macrovascular
                        complications in patients with type 2
                        diabetes.1 Although several studies have demonstrated benefits of intensive glycaemic control in
                        terms of cardiovascular risk and other
                        outcomes, there is also some evidence that very low targets (46mmol/mol, 6.4%) may be associated
                        with increased mortality.1 <br> <br>
                        There is consensus between national (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE]
                        and the Scottish Intercollegiate
                        Guidelines Network [SIGN]) and international guidelines (American Diabetes Association/European
                        Association for the Study of
                        Diabetes [ADA/EASD]) that a ‘reasonable’ HbA1c target for most adult patients with type 2
                        diabetes would be 53mmol/mol (7.0%).1-3 <br> <br>
                        NICE defines good glycaemic control as an HbA1c of 53mmol/mol (7.0%), but stresses the
                        importance of tailoring targets to the
                        individual, to somewhere between 48mmol/mol (6.5%) and 53mmol/mol (7.0%).2
                        SIGN also recommends a target of 53mmol/mol as reasonable to reduce the risk of complications,
                        but suggests that a more stringent
                        target (48mmol/mol [6.5%]) may be appropriate at diagnosis.1 <br> <br>
                        It is important to balance benefits with potential harms, including the risk of hypoglycaemia
                        and weight gain,2 and to involve patients in
                        decisions about targets.2 <br> <br>
                        The more recent ADA/EASD consensus statement also recommends setting individualised glycaemic
                        targets based on patient
                        preferences and goals, the risk of adverse events (hypoglycaemia and weight gain), and patient
                        characteristics, including frailty and
                        comorbid conditions.3 <br><br>
                        <h5 id="head5">NICE2 recommends that clinicians should consider relaxing the target HbA1c level, on a

For those who are treated with a drug
                    associated with hypoglycaemia, the higher target (53mmol/mol [7.0%]) is recommended.1 If HbA1c levels are not adequately controlle by a single drug, and rise to 58mmol/mol (7.5%) or higher, the addition of a second glucose lowering drug is recommended, alongside reinforcing advice on diet, lifestyle and adherence to drug treatment. These patients should be supported to aim for an HbA1c level of 53mmol/mol (7.0%).1 <br>

                        NICE recommends that metformin should be the first line oral hypoglycaemic agent unless contraindicated or not tolerated. The
                        current guideline reminds clinicians that gradual titration of metformin is likely to improve tolerability, and that if standard release
                        metformin is not tolerated, even when introduced at a low dose, modified release metformin may be more readily tolerated.2 <br> <br>
                        Alternatives to metformin (if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated) would include a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor,

                    <hr class="line2">
                    <p>There is evidence for the role of clinical characteristics in informing the choice of first intensification medication (treatment with 2 non-insulin blood glucose lowering therapies in combination: dual therapy) after failure to control blood glucose with metformin and lifestyle interventions. These include the presence of established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), for which there is now evidence to support the use of SGLT2 inhibitors and ucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). There is also evidence that other comorbidities such as heart failure or chronic kidney disease, age and frailty, and the safety and tolerability of medication are also important when selecting first intensification medication. NICE is updating its type 2 diabetes guideline to take account of data from key cardiovascular outcome trials on SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs.1 <br><br>

                    <hr class="line2">
                    <p>There is growing recognition that intensive glucose-lowering treatment in type 2 diabetes has limited benefits and may even dangerous in older people.1 This should prompt clinicians to modify HbA1c targets in patients who are very frail or have limited life expectancy. Guidance developed by the University of Exeter Medical School in collaboration with NHS England commends a target of 64mmol/mol (8.0%) for adults with moderate frailty, and 70mmol/mol (8.5%) for the very frail, elderly patient. The guidance hat metformin may be contraindicated in up to 50% of frail or very frail elderly patients who are likely to have a degree of renal impairment.1 Other agents, including sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors may all have disadvantages in frail, elderly patients. DPP-4 inhibitors have been used in frail and elderly patients, and have similar efficacy in older patients to that inyounger populations. <br><br> 1 railty is fast becoming a critical complication for healthcare professionals to consider, when managing older people and their type 2 diabetes, providing that it has actually been identified for an individual patient. Now more than ever there needs to be clear guidance and support for healthcare professionals in managing this group, especially as the numbers will continue to grow as the population ages.
